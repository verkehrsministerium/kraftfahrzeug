> A serialization agnostic repl for websocket transports

## Design notes

 1. Panes
     - manage panes for inspecting messages and sending a message
     - move focus of pane
     - change contents of statusbar according to pane type
     - view pane name in the lower right corner instead of application name
     - move pane and resize
 2. Design inspect pane
     - TODO
 3. Design send pane
     - TODO
 4. Show messages in abstract object notation (like js objects in google chrome debugger)
     - add highlighting for object notation
        - strings
        - numbers
        - field names
        - parenthesis
        - abbreviations
     - add level based abbreviation for object notation

### Abstract Object Notation

```yaml
{
  null: null,
  bool: true,
  bool2: false,
  int: 42,
  float: 1.0,
  str: "Hello, world",
  array: [1, 2, 3, 4],
  object: { key: "value" },
  binary: <89 50 4e 47 0d 0a 1a 0a...>,
}
```

### Abbreviation for objects

```
{
  data: {
    from: "Sam",
    to: "Max",
    content: "Hello, world!"
  },
  type: "Message"
}
```

to

```
{ data: { from: "Sam", to: "Max", ... }, type: "Message" }
```

> Abbrevations are only present on level `n`, abbreviating all messages deeper than `n` and may abbreviate other message at level `n`. An item on a lower level than `n` (e.g. the root) will never be abbreviated.
